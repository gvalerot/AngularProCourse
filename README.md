# Angular
Hello! 

This is my version of the Angular Pro Course by Todd Motto from UltimateCourses.com 

I used Angular CLI version 19.1.6, in the videos he used Angular 4.x.x

You will need to add a file in src/environments/environment.ts with your firebase config (Realtime Database)

I'm a begginer in Angular world so a LOT of things can be improved here, just wanted to share this version using Standalone Components, maybe it will be useful for someone

:D
